In this book, you will ind a number of styles of text that distinguish between
different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles, and an
explanation of their meaning.
Code words in text, database table names, folder names, ilenames, ile extensions,
pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows:
"The messaging module comes with key abstractions from the Spring Integration
project such as Message, MessageChannel, and MessageHandler to serve as a
foundation for messaging-based applications."
A block of code is set as follows:

public void currencyRoundsOff() throws Exception {
	assertNotNull(CurrencyFormatter.format(100.999));
	assertTrue(CurrencyFormatter.format(100.999).
	contains("$"));
	assertEquals("$101.00", CurrencyFormatter.format(100.999));
}
When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the
relevant lines or items are set in bold:
public class LocaleTest {
	private Locale defaultLocale;
	public void setUp() {
	defaultLocale = Locale.getDefault();
	Locale.setDefault(Locale.GERMANY);
}
